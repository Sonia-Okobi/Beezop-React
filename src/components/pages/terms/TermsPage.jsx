        <ol>
          <li>

            password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
            damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
            under your account. That includes content posted by others who
            either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their
            own logins under your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other
            automated methods are not permitted.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <span class="title">Restricted purposes</span>
        <p>You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Violence, or threats thereof: If an activity qualifies as violent
            crime in Nigeria or where you live, you may not use Beezop products
            to plan, perpetrate, or threaten that activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Child exploitation, sexualization, or abuse: We don’t tolerate any
            activities that create, disseminate, or otherwise cause child abuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Malware or spyware: If you are using our products to make or
            distribute anything that qualifies as malware or spyware — including
            remote user surveillance — be gone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Phishing or otherwise attempting fraud: It is not okay to lie about
            who you are or who you affiliate with to steal from, extort, or
            otherwise harm others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spamming: No one wants unsolicited commercial emails. We don’t
            tolerate folks using Beezop products for spamming purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Infringing on intellectual property: You can’t use Beezop products
            to make or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of
            others beyond the bounds of&nbsp;fair use.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="title"></span>
        <p>
          While our use restrictions are comprehensive, they can’t be exhaustive
          — it’s possible an offense could defy categorization, present for the
          first time, or illuminate a moral quandary we hadn’t yet considered.
          That said, we hope the overarching spirit is clear: Beezop is not to
          be harnessed for harm, whether mental, physical, personal or civic.
        </p>
        <span class="title">Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you are using a paid Service that offers a free trial, we
            communicate the length of trial when you sign up. After the trial
            period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you
            do not pay, we will freeze your account and it will be inaccessible
            until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for a while,
            we will cancel it.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are upgrading from a trial plan to a paid plan, we will
            charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the
            day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the
            new rate starts from the next billing cycle.
          </li>

          <li>
            All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
            taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
            behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
            authorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            We are not responsible for refunds if the Service has not been used.
            When a Beezop account is canceled or deleted, the previous charges
            will not be refunded.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <span class="title">Subscription</span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Some of our services are billed on subscription, your subscription
            will automatically be renewed every 12 months or every month,
            depending on what plan you choose. You will be charged depending on
            your specific plan, on each renewal until you cancel in your account
            settings or by submitting us a support request.
          </li>
          <li>If you cancel, previous charges will not be refunded.</li>
          <li>
            A valid payment method, including a credit card, is required to
            process the payment for your Subscription. By clicking the “Pay”
            button, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <span class="title">Cancellation and Termination</span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.
            Within our Service, we provide a simple no-questions-asked
            cancellation link. If you need help cancelling your account, you can
            always&nbsp;contact our Support team.
          </li>
          <li>
            All of your content will be inaccessible from the Service
            immediately upon cancellation. Within 60 days, all content will be
            permanently deleted from our active systems and backups.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
            month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will
            not be charged again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once your account has been canceled, we have no responsibility for
            providing you with access to your content once your Beezop account
            has been canceled.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
            any and all current or future use of our Service for any reason at
            any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account
            will not be able to access the account or any content in the
            account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your
            account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and
            relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the
            right to refuse the use of the Service to anyone for any reason at
            any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse
            or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in
            immediate account termination.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <span class="title">Modifications to the Service and Prices</span>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we
            do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes.
            However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers.
            If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify
            you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about
            changes on our website or the affected Service themselves.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <span class="title">Security and Privacy</span>
        <ol>
          <li>

            applications seriously.
          </li>
          <li>
            We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your
            usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of
            the Service. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before
            taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may
            negatively impact the performance of the Service for other
            customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining your own backups of your
            content. We do not provide backup services and we exclude liability
